Constants

Universal gravitational constant - source: http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm
Units: N-m2/kg2

Vernal Equinox is assumed to be out the x axis for conversion from spherical coordinates to cartesian in the plotting function(s).

Equations

Many equations come from here: http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm
True anomaly for highly eccentric orbits comes from here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01227859 as summarized here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_anomaly
The arccosine only fits between 0 and pi, and thus cannot be used for tracking an orbit throughout its entire period.
